# Problem Description:
## You are given a sorted array which is rotated at some random pivot point.

Example: [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You can assume there are no duplicates in the array and your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of `O(log n).`

Example:

Input:` nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0, Output: 4`

Here is some boilerplate code and test cases to start with:

```python
def rotated_array_search(input_list, number):
    """
    Find the index by searching in a rotated sorted array

    Args:
       input_list(array), number(int): Input array to search and the target
    Returns:
       int: Index or -1
    """
   pass

def linear_search(input_list, number):
    for index, element in enumerate(input_list):
        if element == number:
            return index
    return -1

def test_function(test_case):
    input_list = test_case[0]
    number = test_case[1]
    if linear_search(input_list, number) == rotated_array_search(input_list, number):
        print("Pass")
    else:
        print("Fail")

test_function([[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4], 6])
test_function([[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1])
test_function([[6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4], 8])
test_function([[6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1])
test_function([[6, 7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4], 10])
```

# Analysis:
## Time Complexity:
The time complexity is `O(log(n))`. Refer Design Choices section.

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity is `O(log(n))`. The `input_list` gets split into 2.

## Design Choices:
I chose to do a binary search splitting each list into left and right halves until finding the number provided as an input.
